# Third-party configurations for VS Code

These are my personal configurations in VS Code. In case you want to use them,
download and replace them with the ones in your vscode. To do so:

- Open VS Code
- **File** &rarr; **Preferences** &rarr; **User snippets**
- Search for **c/cpp.json** and press enter
- Now you can just copy my configurations into yours or just replace them.
